# NLP Playground
### Environment
All of projects were built using:
- Python 3.10.6 (pip 22.3.1)
- WSL Ubuntu 20.04
- Colab (mostly like a terminal with GPU)

So there is no need in special hardware to reproduce any results.

- **Note**: You can find pre-built virtual environments in `./venvs` folder 
if needed.

That repository contains some educational NLP small projects. Here is 
the list of projects have been implemented at the moment:
- [Tokenizer](./tokenizer)
- [Word2Vec](./word2vec/)
